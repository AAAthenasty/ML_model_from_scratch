In this file, I implement a working Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, 
i.e., a sentiment polarity analyzer, using binary logistic regression. \
I use this algorithm to determine whether a review is positive or negative using movie reviews as data. \
I have done some very basic feature engineering, through which the learnerâ€™s performance is improved on this task.
There are two programs: feature.py and lr.py, they jointly complete the task.

Some example datasets are uploaded
