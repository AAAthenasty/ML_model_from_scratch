# Inspection Model File

The inspection.py calculates the label entropy at the root (i.e. the entropy of the labels before any splits) 
and the error rate (the percent of incorrectly classified instances) of classifying using a majority vote (picking the label with the most examples). 


# Decision Tree Model File
The decisionTree.py implements a Decision Tree learner with Python numpy. 
This file learn a decision tree with a specified maximum depth,
print the decision tree in a specified format, 
predict the labels of the training and testing examples,
and calculate training and testing errors.
